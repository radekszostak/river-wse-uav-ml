# About
This repostory contains code and machine learning dataset used in article *Estimation of river water surface elevation using UAV photogrammetry and machine learning*.

# Running the training
Use [ml/main.ipynb](https://github.com/radekszostak/river-wse-uav-ml/blob/master/ml/main.ipynb) notebook to run single training and evaluation.

Use [ml/k_fold.sh](https://github.com/radekszostak/river-wse-uav-ml/blob/master/ml/k_fold.sh) script to run training and evaluation five times (for each k_fold subset).

# Result visualisation
Scripts used to create plots and result tables featured in article are generated using scripts and data from [plots](https://github.com/radekszostak/river-wse-uav-ml/tree/master/plots) directory.
